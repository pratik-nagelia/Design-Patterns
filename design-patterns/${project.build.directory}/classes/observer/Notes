The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its
dependents are notified and updated automatically.


Design Principle
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.
